Authentication Service for ARGO API(s)


## Description

The purpose of the Authentication Service is to provide the ability to different services to use alternative authentication mechanisms without having to store additional user info or implement new functionalities.The AUTH service holds various information about a serviceâ€™s users, hosts, API urls, etc, and leverages them to provide its functionality. 

## Perquisites

Before you start, you need to issue a valid certificate.

## Set Up

1. Install Golang 1.10
2. Create a new work space:

      `mkdir ~/go-workspace`
      
      `export GOPATH=~/go-workspace`
      
      `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`

     You may add the last `export` line into the `~/.bashrc`, `/.zshrc` or the `~/.bash_profile` file to have `GOPATH` environment variable properly setup upon every login.

3. Get the latest version

      `go get github.com/ARGOeu/argo-api-authn`

4. Get dependencies(If you plan on contributing to the project else skip this step):

   Argo-api-authN uses the dep tool for dependency handling.
    
    - Install the dep tool. You can find instructions depending on your platform at [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

5. To build the service use the following command:

      `go build`

6. To run the service use the following command:

      `./argo-api-authn` (This assumes that there is a valid configuration file at `/etc/argo-api-authn/conf.d/argo-api-authn-config.json`).
      
      Else
      
      `./argo-api-authn --config /path/to/a/json/config/file`

7. To run the unit-tests:

    Inside the project's folder issue the command:

      `go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)`
 
 8. Install mongoDB
 
 
 ## Configuration
 
 The service depends on a configuration file in order to be able to run.This file contains the following information:
 
 ```json
 {
   "service_port":8080,
   "mongo_host":"mongo_host",
   "mongo_db":"mongo database",
   "certificate_authorities":"/path/to/cas/certificates/",
   "certificate":"/path/to/cert/localhost.crt",
   "certificate_key":"/path/to/key/localhost.key",
   "service_token": "some-token",
   "supported_auth_types": ["x509", "oidc"],
   "supported_auth_methods": ["api-key", "x-api-token"],
   "verify_ssl": true
 }
 ```
 
 ## Helpful Utilities
 You can find various utility scripts to help you get up and running the service inside the
 repo's `bin` folder. You can also find the respective documentation for the scripts inside the `docs` folder.
